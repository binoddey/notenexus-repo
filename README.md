# Note Nexus – Frontend Showcase Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a **curated subset of frontend components** from the NoteNexus platform.  
It is published as a **public-facing showcase** to demonstrate product UI structure, frontend engineering practices, and design implementation.

**Note:** This repository does **not** represent the complete Note Nexus product.

## Business Context

**Note Nexus** is an education-focused platform aimed at simplifying access to structured academic resources for BTech students.

The platform is being built as a **scalable ed-tech product**, with clear separation between:
- Presentation layer (UI/UX)
- Core business logic
- Data, content, and infrastructure

This repository intentionally exposes **only the presentation layer** to maintain:
- Intellectual property protection  
- Competitive advantage  
- Data and user privacy

## Scope of This Repository

### Included Components

The repository includes **static and client-side frontend files**, such as:

- Landing page UI
- Feature overview pages
- Contact page layout
- Footer components (FAQ, Privacy Policy, Disclaimer)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used strictly for presentation

These components are sufficient to understand:
- UI structure
- Design consistency
- Frontend code organization

- Backend services or APIs  
- Databases or authentication mechanisms
